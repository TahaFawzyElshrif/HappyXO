    "### this ***android app*** is XO game (tic-tac-toe) that offer\n",
    "\n",
    "    - play with AI (using minimax, alpha purning algorithm )\n",
    "    - play with another user (this version restricted on one mobile phone ,see limitation)\n",
    "    - game configuration (change play level)\n",
    "\n",
    "## how to use app:\n",
    "easy interface with animations : after installition you can:\n",
    "- choose to play with AI (robot logo)\n",
    "- choose to play with another person (user with laptop logo)\n",
    "- choose game configuration (playstation logo)\n",

    "### Python code:\n",
    "- static_eval : given XO matrix ***should be n*n*** return evelution of this matrix such that :\n",
    "- 0: no one won,game haven't finished \n",
    "- 1:computer won or opponent won (in user game)\n",
    "- -1:user won\n",
    "- alphabeta_decide : main method , alpha beta with min-max return static_eval\n",
    "- get_best_position : from alphabeta_decide get the new matrix with new step\n",
    "- :compare 2 matrix (before step,after step) (logically one step done) and get certain step (step is indices in matrix to use it in java easily)\n",
    "- get_best_step :from get_best_position get  get step not matrix \n",
    "- StringToList convert list (got from java using chaquo as string) to list \n",
    "### java code\n",
    "- Utils is mostly used methods in app  dialog,go to activity ,startPython ,format data sent to python \n",
    "- one method is ArrayToBracket that given java 2d array (represent matrix) convert it to string of python 2d list (to send to python then recognized in StringToList)\n",
    "- in (splach screen) it load SharedPreferences \n",
    "- loaded SharedPreferences data are loaded in memory with static attributes in Settings\n",
    "- SharedPreferences are created /changed in configuration Activity ,and put default on Activity when loaded\n",
    "- XO_Ai ,XO_user are nearly same but difference in main code ,i put many shared methods in XO_user as static methods but some methods ,copied it as it some difficult to make static\n",
    "- i tried to make code orgainzed as possible\n",
